My Hobby
==================

I love music - most genres, a variety of instruments, and I absolutely adore playing. My main instrument is the violin, but I can also play a little bit of the guitar. When I have the time to pick up an instrument, I play mostly folk music, primarily from the British Isles, as it is fun, energetic, and a great way to practice.
