About
================

This is a student portfolio for the *Teknisk webbdesign och användbarhet* course at Blekinge Tekniska Högskola.

This website uses the following technologies:
* HTML
* CSS
* SASS: A CSS pre-processor which reduces repetitive of CSS code, makes your code more structured, and has extra features such as nested functions, variables, and imports.
* Markdown: A "lightweight" markup language - precisely what I am using to write this text now. From a author's point of view, it is much easier or *natural* to write in Markdown than in plain HTML.
* Twig
* JavaScript
